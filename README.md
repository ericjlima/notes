Steps to run this app.


1.) Have mysql installed and create an empty DB.
2.) Look at routes/notes and replace the credentials with your own.
3.) Uncomment the lines in routes/notes if you wish to easily create the DB structure. Feel free to recomment them afterwards.
4.) Run "npm install" and "node bin/www" from the root of the project via the terminal.
5.) Go to /client and run "npm install && npm start"

If you can get the front end to display the update, I will send you $5 dollars via Bitcoin Cash or Paypal...
